<div class="container">
  <h2>jQuery Slidious &ndash; Basic Example &ndash; Page 3</h2>
  <p>Slidious uses percentage values for all animations and page dimensions.</p>
  <p>This makes your page fully responsive. Also you will have to take care of your content yourself. Slidious just handles the containers.</p>
  <p>Try it out by resizing the container. You can go back to the previous page & play around a bit.</p>
  <p>Slidious (yeah, I get paid for writing the name) hides the provided menu by default. You can deactivate this & use the menu like all other page links.</p>
  <p>Here's the menu again. Where do you want to go next?</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="ajax/page-1.html">Page 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="ajax/page-2.html">Page 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="ajax/page-4.html">Page 4</a></li>
    <li><a href="ajax/page-5.html">Page 5</a></li>
  </ul>
