  <h2>jQuery Slidious &ndash; Basic Example &ndash; Page 2</h2>
  <p>Hm, this was really fast. No lag what so ever. Guess what...</p>
  <p>By default Slidious preloads all linked pages to make the user experience seemless.</p>
  <p>You can change the preloading behaviour of course. Check out <a href="https://github.com/christianhanne/slidious#readme">the documentation</a> for details.</p>
  <p>Did I mention, that Slidious scans new content for links automatically and handles external links (like the one above) differently from (registered) <a href="ajax/page-3.html">internal ones</a>.</p>
